What is Algorithm:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a particular problem.
Obiously there are various ways to solve a problem. 

This means the method I picked to solve a problem can be differ from someone else's method. 
But at the end we should both get the same result.

Because there are various ways to solve a problem, there time and space.must be a measure to evaluate the algorithms 
or methods on the basis of efficieny and performance (the time algorithm takes to execute and the memory it uses). 


Asymptotic Notations: 
Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to describe the performance or complexity of algorithms when the 
input size (n) approaches infinity or become very large. 

Types of Asymptotic Notations:

1. Big-O notation: worst case scenario --> it is the upper bound of the algorithm. Representation: O(n) or O(1) etc.

2. Omega notation: best case scenario --> it is the lower bound of the algorithm. Representation: Ω(n) or Ω(1) etc.

3. Theta notation: average case scenario --> it is the average bound of the algorithm. Representation: θ(n) or θ(1) etc.



Important notes: 

While we generally use Big-O notation  (worst case) to measure the performance of an algorithm.

What is Time Complexity:
Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input (denoted as n) increases. 

Unlike actual runtime, which can vary based on hardware, time complexity provides the general idea of algorithm's efficiency. 

This is why it is crucial for coding interviews - interviewers are more interested in the scalability and efficiency
of our algorithm rather than its raw execution speed. 


As we earlier discussed, we generally use Big-O notation (worst case) to measure the performance of an algorithm. 

In Big-O there are six major types of time complexities: 

1. O(1) : constant time complexity

2. O(n) : linear time complexity

3. O(n log n) : logarithmic time complexity

4. O(n^2) : quadratic time complexity

5. O(2^n) : exponential time complexity

6. O(n!) : factorial time complexity


Let's discuss which of them are best, good and bad

--> O(1) : Excellent/Best

--> O(log n) : Good

--> O(n) : Fair

--> O(n log n) : Bad

--> O(n^2), O(2^n), O(n!) : Terrible/Worst

Let's break down the partition algorithm through a more visual approach, step by step. We'll take a simple array for demonstration.

### Example
Let's say we have the following array:

```
Array: [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
```

We will choose the **last element** (`5`) as our pivot for this example.

### Step-by-Step Visualization

1. **Initial Setup**
   - **Array:** `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`
   - **Pivot:** `5`
   - **Index of smaller element (`i`):** Initially set to `-1`
   - **Current element index (`j`):** Starts from `0`

2. **Iterate through the array**
   We will compare each element with the pivot (`5`) and rearrange them:

- **Iteration 1 (j = 0):**
  - **Element:** `10`
  - **Comparison:** `10 > 5` (don't do anything)
  - Array remains: `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`
  
- **Iteration 2 (j = 1):**
  - **Element:** `7`
  - **Comparison:** `7 > 5` (don't do anything)
  - Array remains: `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`

- **Iteration 3 (j = 2):**
  - **Element:** `8`
  - **Comparison:** `8 > 5` (don't do anything)
  - Array remains: `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`

- **Iteration 4 (j = 3):**
  - **Element:** `9`
  - **Comparison:** `9 > 5` (don't do anything)
  - Array remains: `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`

- **Iteration 5 (j = 4):**
  - **Element:** `1`
  - **Comparison:** `1 <= 5` (increment `i` to `0` and swap)
  - Swap `1` with the element at index `i` (which is `10`).
  - Array becomes: `[1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5]`
  - Index `i` is now `0`.

3. **Finalizing the Pivot**
- After completing the iterations, we swap the pivot (`5`) with the element at `i + 1` (which is index `1`):
  - So, swap `5` with `7`.
  - Array becomes: `[1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 7]`

Now the pivot `5` is at its final sorted position, which is at index `1`.

### Result of the Partition Function
After partitioning, the array looks like this:
```
[1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 7]
```
- All elements left of the pivot (`5`) are less than or equal to `5`.
- All elements to the right are greater than `5`.

### New Pivot Index
The index of the pivot `5` is `1`, which will now be used to sort the elements on the left side (`[1]`) and the right side (`[8, 9, 10, 7]`) recursively.

### Recursive Calls
Now you can run the `quickSort` algorithm on the two halves:
- For the left section: **No sorting is needed** because it's one element.
- For the right section `[8, 9, 10, 7]`, the process repeats with a new pivot each time until the entire array is sorted.

### Final Sorted Array
After recursively applying the partition method to all segments, the final sorted array will be:
```
[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### Conclusion
The partition algorithm effectively organizes the elements around a chosen pivot, allowing for efficient sorting in place with preliminary arrangements. It finds the pivot's final position while maintaining relative order among elements on either side of the pivot. In QuickSort, this is repeated recursively, leading to a sorted array.

Let's simplify the explanation even further using a clearer approach, with a focus on how the variables are updated at each step as we go through the array.

### Goal

We want to find the **first smallest** and **second smallest** numbers in the given array:
`[7, 3, 1, 4, 2]`

### Key Variables

- **firstSmallest**: Initially set to a very large number (infinity).
- **secondSmallest**: Initially set to a very large number (infinity).

### Starting Values

Before we begin looping through the array:
- **firstSmallest = ∞**
- **secondSmallest = ∞**

### Step-by-Step Iteration

Let's go through the elements of the array one by one.

#### **1. Look at 7**

- Check if 7 is less than **firstSmallest** (∞):
  - **Yes**! So we update:
    - `firstSmallest = 7`
    - `secondSmallest` remains ∞.

**Current State:**
- **firstSmallest = 7**
- **secondSmallest = ∞**

#### **2. Look at 3**

- Check if 3 is less than **firstSmallest** (7):
  - **Yes**! Update:
    - Set `secondSmallest = firstSmallest` (7) first.
    - Then update `firstSmallest = 3`.

**Current State:**
- **firstSmallest = 3**
- **secondSmallest = 7**

#### **3. Look at 1**

- Check if 1 is less than **firstSmallest** (3):
  - **Yes**! Update:
    - Set `secondSmallest = firstSmallest` (3) first.
    - Then update `firstSmallest = 1`.

**Current State:**
- **firstSmallest = 1**
- **secondSmallest = 3**

#### **4. Look at 4**

- Check if 4 is less than **firstSmallest** (1):
  - **No** (4 is greater than 1).
- Check if 4 is less than **secondSmallest** (3):
  - **No** (4 is greater than 3).
- **No changes** made.

**Current State:**
- **firstSmallest = 1**
- **secondSmallest = 3**

#### **5. Look at 2**

- Check if 2 is less than **firstSmallest** (1):
  - **No** (2 is greater than 1).
- Check if 2 is less than **secondSmallest** (3):
  - **Yes**! Update:
    - `secondSmallest = 2`.

**Current State:**
- **firstSmallest = 1**
- **secondSmallest = 2**

### Final Result

After we checked all the elements in the array:
- **First Smallest**: 1
- **Second Smallest**: 2

### Summary

Here’s a recap of what we did:
- We set up two variables to track the smallest and second smallest numbers.
- We went through each number in the array and compared it to our current smallest and second smallest.
- We updated the variables as needed based on the comparisons.

### Pseudocode Representation

For a quick reference, here's how the logic can be summarized in simple pseudocode:

```plaintext
1. Initialize firstSmallest and secondSmallest to infinity (∞).
2. For each number in the array:
   a. If the number is less than firstSmallest:
      - Set secondSmallest to firstSmallest.
      - Update firstSmallest to the number.
   b. Else if the number is less than secondSmallest and not equal to firstSmallest:
      - Update secondSmallest to the number.
3. End loop.
4. Output firstSmallest and secondSmallest.
```

### Conclusion

This explanation highlights how the variables are updated at each step in a straightforward manner. By the end of our iterations through the array, we found that the first smallest number is **1** and the second smallest is **2**!

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step summary of the two-pass algorithm used to segregate positive and negative numbers in an array:

### Step-by-Step Summary of the Two-Pass Algorithm

#### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Input**: Start with an unsorted array containing both positive and negative integers.
- **Example Array**: 
  ```
  [12, -7, 5, -3, 6, -2, -1, 8]
  ```

#### **Step 2: First Pass - Collect Non-Negative Elements**
- **Objective**: Identify and collect all non-negative integers (0 and positive numbers).
- **Process**:
  - Loop through each element of the array.
  - If an element is non-negative, add it to the result array.
- **Accumulated Results** after the first pass:
  ```
  Result: [12, 5, 6, 8]
  ```

#### **Step 3: Second Pass - Collect Negative Elements**
- **Objective**: Identify and collect all negative integers.
- **Process**:
  - Loop through the original array again.
  - If an element is negative, add it to the result array.
- **Accumulated Results** after the second pass:
  ```
  Result: [12, 5, 6, 8, -7, -3, -2, -1]
  ```

#### **Step 4: Update the Original Array**
- **Action**: Assign the combined results back to the original array.
- **Final Segregated Array**:
  ```
  [12, 5, 6, 8, -7, -3, -2, -1]
  ```

### Summary of Results
1. **First Pass**:
   - Collects all non-negative numbers.
   - Intermediate Result: `[12, 5, 6, 8]`

2. **Second Pass**:
   - Collects all negative numbers.
   - Final Combined Result: `[12, 5, 6, 8, -7, -3, -2, -1]`

3. **Final Output**:
   - The original array is modified to contain the segregated results.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array, because each loop iterates through the array independently.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the result array that stores the segregated elements.

This structured approach of using two passes provides clear segmentation between positive and negative integers in a straightforward manner. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
